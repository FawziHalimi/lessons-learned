One key take away from the course was how to approach the development of software and how to communicate with programmers. User stories are a very easy and efficient tool to break an app, website or other software into pieces so that a programmer can understand what to do, for whom and what is the purpose. In addition user stories help us to manage the software development process efficiently through Kanban or a similar method in which user stories flow through a "production process" until they are deployed.
