We should always keep in mind the type of service we're providing and the use-cases of our users when deciding whether we should develop a mobile app or a mobile-optimized webb app.
If our users will likely need to input a lot of information(especially text), or use our service for complex tasks, it is best to design a web service, which can be mobile-optimized. Otherwise, if our user will need to conduct quick tasks on the go, we are better off developing an app to offer our service

Here is a good blog post about it:
