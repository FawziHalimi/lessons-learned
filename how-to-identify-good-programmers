There are several charactersitics that a good programmer should present:
- Has to be collaborative both with business partners and with the rest of the technical team.
- Needs to be updated (new technologies, frameworks, etc).
- Should have some documentation process in order to track change requests and modifications in the code.
- Has to develop a robust testing process to ensure that requirements go to production only when they have been properly tested.

The three questions to ask to know whether you're hiring a good programmer:
What unit testing/version control/framework do you use? Why? What did you compare it to?
